                        <p class="testi-txt">I have been looking for a new company to do the website development I need. I sent a small site to Travis Smith at Design Layer Agency - their quote was very reasonable, so I gave the 'go-ahead'...<br>
                            <span style="display: none;"> and within a relatively short time, I had a nice mockup, and shortly after than a secondary pages mockup, and then they made the site. It looked and worked perfectly!<br>
                                We approved the newly completed site, and Design Layer Agency installed the new site on my server after zipping up and saving the old site for us. They made the change over a 'hands-off' experience for me!<br>
                                As is typical, my client (who we had the website made for) wanted changes. They almost always want changes after the site is done because they have new ideas after seeing their creation come to life. So I sent the requests along and Design Layer Agency happily made the changes for me. They also helped figure out a couple little glitches, caused by my client, with speed and without complaint.<br>
                                Now today, I just gave them the go-ahead to start on the 3 new sites for me, and I have 2 more in the works to send their way as soon as I get the approvals from my new clients.</span>
